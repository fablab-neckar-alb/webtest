Open call for glitch art aimed at any and all who make stuff by breaking stuff. We will materialize your digital randomness into hardcopied objects, screen your videos, click your net art and run your sound installations through air. Any digital media and any glitch technique will be considered, as long as they are presentable in the form of a digital print, sound installation, a website, or a video projection.

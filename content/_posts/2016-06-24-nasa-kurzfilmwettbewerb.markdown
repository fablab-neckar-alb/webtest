<blockquote>NASA (yes, that [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)) and the [Houston Cinema Arts Society](http://cinemartsociety.org/) have teamed up to organize a contest that is pretty out of this world. The short film competition, [CineSpace](https://herox.com/cinespace16), offers filmmakers around the world a chance to share their works inspired by—and created with—actual NASA imagery. That gives you quite a bit to work with— 50 years' worth of universe exploration, to be precise.

Not that you'll even need that much footage; submissions are only required to feature at least 10% of NASA video imagery. The imagery may be obtained through the [NASA Image Archives](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/download-nasa-videos-for-cinespace) or other publicly available means, such as YouTube.
